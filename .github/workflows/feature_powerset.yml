# Check to build Roadster with all combinations (powerset) of features. Because we have a bunch of features, the
# powerset of all features is quite large, meaning we need to run a large number of iterations of the tests. To
# conserve CI usage, as well as mimimize CI time needed on PRs, we'll only run checks against the feature powerset
# once a week, and only if a commit was merged in the past week.
