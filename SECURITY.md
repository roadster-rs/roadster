# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The most-recently-released version of the library is supported with security updates.
For example, if a security issue is discovered that affects an old version (e.g. 0.5.1)
and the latest release (e.g. 0.6.7) a new 0.6.x patch will be released but a new 0.5.x
patch release will not be made. You should plan to update to the latest version to
receive any new features or bugfixes of any kind.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a suspected security issue, you can contact security@roadster.dev rather than opening
a public issue.
