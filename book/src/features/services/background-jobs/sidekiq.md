# Background jobs with Sidekiq

[Sidekiq](https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq) is a popular system for running background and cron jobs in Ruby on Rails
apps. Roadster provides built-in support for running background jobs with [Sidekiq](https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq)
via the [Sidekiq.rs](https://docs.rs/rusty-sidekiq/latest/sidekiq/) crate, which provides a Rust interface for
interacting with a Sidekiq server (e.g., a Redis server).

Below is an example of how to register a worker and enqueue it into the job queue. See
the [Sidekiq.rs](https://docs.rs/rusty-sidekiq/latest/sidekiq/) for more details on implementing [
`Worker`](https://docs.rs/rusty-sidekiq/latest/sidekiq/trait.Worker.html)s.
