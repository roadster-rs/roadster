# Background jobs with Sidekiq

[Sidekiq](https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq) is a popular system for running background and cron jobs in Ruby on Rails
apps. Roadster provides built-in support for running background jobs with [Sidekiq](https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq)
via the [Sidekiq.rs](https://docs.rs/rusty-sidekiq/latest/sidekiq/) crate, which provides a Rust interface for
interacting with a Sidekiq server (e.g., a Redis server).

Below is an example of how to register a worker and enqueue it into the job queue. See
the [Sidekiq.rs](https://docs.rs/rusty-sidekiq/latest/sidekiq/) for more details on implementing [
`Worker`](https://docs.rs/rusty-sidekiq/latest/sidekiq/trait.Worker.html)s.

## Service configs

Various properties of the Sidekiq worker service can be configured via the app's config files. The most important fields
to configure are the following:

- `service.sidekiq.num-workers`: The number of Sidekiq workers that can run at the same time.
- `service.sidekiq.queues`: The names of the worker queues to handle.
- `service.sidekiq.redis.uri`: The URI of the Redis database to use as the Sidekiq server.

```toml
{{ #include ../../../../examples/service/config/development/sidekiq.toml }}
```

See
the [config struct](https://docs.rs/roadster/latest/roadster/config/service/worker/sidekiq/struct.SidekiqServiceConfig.html)
for the full list of fields available.
