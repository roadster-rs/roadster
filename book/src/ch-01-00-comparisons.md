# Web framework comparisons

This chapter compares [Roadster](https://crates.io/crates/roadster) to other Rust web frameworks to help you determine
if Roadster is the best fit for your project.

If you're considering Roadster, we assume you have already decided that Rust is the best fit for your project.
Therefore, we do not provide comparisons to non-Rust web frameworks, such
as [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/), [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), or [Laravel](https://laravel.com/).
