/*
A note for future maintainers: This `Service`-specific trait is required to get a `&dyn Any`
for the service because the following don't work:

1. General `AsAny` trait with a global impl -- doesn't work because this also implements `AsAny`
   for `Box`, which prevents us from getting `&dyn Any` for the actual `Service` that we want.
```rust
trait AsAny {
    fn as_any(&self) -> &dyn Any;
}
impl<T> AsAny for T {
    fn as_any(&self) -> &dyn Any {
        self
    }
}
```

2. General `AsAny` trait only implemented for specific traits, e.g. `Service` -- doesn't work
   for `Service` because Rust considers the `A` and `S` type parameters as unconstrained.
```rust
trait AsAny {
    fn as_any(&self) -> &dyn Any;
}
impl<T, A, S> AsAny for T
where
    S: Clone + Send + Sync + 'static,
    AppContext: FromRef<S>,
    A: App<S> + 'static,
    // Even though `A` and `S` appear here, Rust considers them unconstrained.
    T: Service<A, S>
{
    fn as_any(&self) -> &dyn Any {
        self
    }
}
```
