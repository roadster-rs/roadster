# Leptos Example Config

The `cargo leptos watch` command changes directories to the root of the `roadster` project, so we need to put the
config files for our leptos examples here in the root dir.

Similarly, if you use a `.env` file, you need to put it at the root of the `roadster` project (if running one of
our Leptos examples).
