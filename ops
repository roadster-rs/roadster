E.g.\n\n- Include them in the crate exports then consumers can include them via an embedding? May need to figure out how to support multiple diesel migration sources in this case.\n- Require consumers to copy them from source. Not ideal but may be okay to start with. Also means it's impossible to break consumers by accidentally changing an old migration file.\n\n _Originally posted by @spencewenski in [#611](https://github.com/roadster-rs/roadster/issues/611#issuecomment-2661396536)_","files":null}]}
