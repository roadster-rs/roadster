This isn't ideal because it means the consumer would be testing against a slightly different SQL implementation if they are using mysql or sqlite in prod.\n\nWe should instead create the container based on either the original conn string or the container image provided in the config. Or check both and make sure they match?\n\nhttps://github.com/roadster-rs/roadster/blob/b654a26a63a98e2c9f0be4e983e9976584c05431/src/app/context.rs#L689","files":null}]}
