E.g.\n\n- Include them in the crate exports then consumers can include them via an embedding? May need to figure out how to support multiple diesel migration sources in this case (https://github.com/roadster-rs/roadster/issues/624).\n- Require consumers to copy them from source. Not ideal but may be okay to start with. Also means it's impossible to break consumers by accidentally changing an old migration file.\n\n _Originally posted by @spencewenski in [#611](https://github.com/roadster-rs/roadster/issues/611#issuecomment-2661396536)_","files":null},{"type":5,"timestamp":1741144829,"nonce":"8fzfkWQOOu/rlHn7J2poMD3qi/c=","metadata":{"github-id":"LE_lADOLg8lJc6qaLMazwAAAAPcq2xe"},"added":["api-compatible"],"removed":[]}]}
