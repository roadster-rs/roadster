If no db is running, the cli will not run. We have a couple options:\n\n1. Can we create the db connection pool (sql, redis, etc) without needing for it to be able to actually connect to the db?\n2. If (1) is not possible, we can add a method to the `RunCommand` trait that runs right after the app config is parsed (and tracing is initialized) and before the app context is created.","files":null}]}
