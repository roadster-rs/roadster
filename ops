In comparison, our [current approach](https://github.com/roadster-rs/roadster/blob/2aef4f0d25b87200370fe8f578b4c411117c3b6e/src/config/service/http/middleware.rs#L254) is pretty convoluted and requires a lot of boilerplate.\n\nThe only downside of a config file approach is how would we provide the default priorities for the middleware, etc? Hard code in the config? Or continue with our dynamic approach?","files":null}]}
