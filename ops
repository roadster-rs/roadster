However, I think this approach makes it more difficult to pass the AppContext and custom App::State to the consumer. We might be able to do it by requiring a callback in each builder method that provides the context. However, I think this would, somewhat paradoxically, increase the boilerplate required to build the app. It would also probably be less intuitive for users who are new to rust and/or roadster.","files":null},{"type":4,"timestamp":1711912216,"nonce":"lv72oZlijo3uXaObPcVxVX/yLN4=","metadata":{"github-id":"CE_lADOLg8lJc6D8FTizwAAAALdaZtt"},"status":2}]}
