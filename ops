In that case, we can provide a feature flag to remove it at compile time.\n\nWe probably don't want to add individual feature flags for each middleware, as that would greatly complicate how we build/test `roadster` in CI. Maybe if we split the default middleware out to a separate crate it would be more manageable, but we'll leave that for a later optimization if needed.","files":null}]}
