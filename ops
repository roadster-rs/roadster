That way, they can define for themselves what they want to use for the version, e.g., the git hash, the cargo package version, etc (we can provide some examples of each). Then, the version should be added as the `SERVICE_VERSION` on the top-level otel resource.\n\nI'm not sure how useful it is to add the roadster version anywhere. If the consumer uses the git hash as the version, for example, they can easily lookup what version of roadster was used in that commit.","files":null},{"type":4,"timestamp":1717876368,"nonce":"Ojb8x4vLa72UVnf4Y5PmsVwhNaU=","metadata":{"github-id":"CE_lADOLg8lJc6FOHY0zwAAAAMMLSKA"},"status":2}]}
